## Course Overview

This page focuses on the course _14.11 Insights from Game Theory into Social Behavior_ as it was taught by Dr. Moshe Hoffman and Dr. Erez Yoeli in Fall 2013.

This course applies insights from game theory to explain human social behavior, focusing on novel applications which have heretofore been the realm of psychologists and philosophers—for example, why people speak indirectly, in what sense beauty is socially constructed, and where our moral intuitions come from—and eschewing traditional economic applications such as industrial organization or auctions.

We will employ standard games such as the prisoner's dilemma, coordination, hawk-dove, and costly signaling, and use standard game theory tools such as Nash Equilibria, Subgame Perfection, and Perfect Bayesian Equilibria.

## Course Outcomes
